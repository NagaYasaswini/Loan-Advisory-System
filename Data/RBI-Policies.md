# RBI-Aligned Policies and Eligibilities for Applying and Getting Loans from Banks

## Introduction

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates the banking sector in India to ensure transparency, fair practices, and financial stability. RBI guidelines on loans and advances cover aspects such as Know Your Customer (KYC) norms, creditworthiness assessment, interest rate linkages to external benchmarks, and specific requirements for different loan types. These apply to all scheduled commercial banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). Borrowers must meet eligibility criteria based on credit score, income, and purpose of the loan. This document summarizes key RBI-aligned policies and eligibilities for major loan categories, focusing on application and approval processes. All banks must adhere to the Fair Practices Code, ensuring transparent communication and no harassment during recovery.

**Note:** Policies are subject to updates; always verify with the latest RBI circulars. As of September 28, 2025, repo rate is 6.00%.

## General RBI Guidelines for All Loans
