# RBI-Aligned Policies and Eligibilities for Applying and Getting Loans from Banks

## Introduction

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates the banking sector in India to ensure transparency, fair practices, and financial stability. RBI guidelines on loans and advances cover aspects such as Know Your Customer (KYC) norms, creditworthiness assessment, interest rate linkages to external benchmarks, and specific requirements for different loan types. These apply to all scheduled commercial banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). Borrowers must meet eligibility criteria based on credit score, income, and purpose of the loan. This document summarizes key RBI-aligned policies and eligibilities for major loan categories, focusing on application and approval processes. All banks must adhere to the Fair Practices Code, ensuring transparent communication and no harassment during recovery.

**Note:** Policies are subject to updates; always verify with the latest RBI circulars. As of September 28, 2025, repo rate is 6.00%.

The Chairman / Managing Director/ 
Chief Executive Officer 
All Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs & SFBs) and 
All NBFC-ND-SIs 
 
Dear Sir/ Madam, 
 
Co-origination of loans by Banks and NBFCs for lending to priority sector 
 
Please refer to Para 3 of the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies  of 
the Third Bi-Monthly Monetary Policy Statement 2018-19 dated August 1, 2018 , introducing 
the Co-origination Model between Banks and  Non-Banking Financial Companies - Non-
Deposit taking - Systemically Important (NBFC-ND-SIs) for providing competitive credit to 
priority sector. The detailed guidelines in this regard are as under.  
  
2. All scheduled commercial banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks and Small Finance 
Banks) may engage with N BFC-ND-SIs (hereinafter referred to as NBFC)  to co-originate 
loans for the creation of priority sector assets. The arrangement should entail joint 
contribution of credit at the facility level, by both lenders. It should also involve sharing of 
risks and rewards between the bank and the NBFC for ensuring appropriate alignment of 
respective business objectives , as per the mutually decided agreement between the bank 
and the NBFC, inter-alia, covering the essential features as indicated in Annex 1.  
 
3. The bank can claim priority sector status in respect of its share of credit while engaging in  
the co-origination arrangement. However, the priority sector assets on the bank ’s books 
should at all times be without recourse to the NBFC. Further, the loans extended by foreign 
banks under the co-origination framework  shall be restricted only to loans qualifying as  
priority sector assets.

Co-origination of loans by Banks and NBFCs for lending to priority sector 
 
4. Based on the respective interest rates and proportion of risk sharin g, a single blended 
interest rate should be offered to the ultimate borrower  in case of fixed rate loans. In the 
scenario of floating interest rates , a weighted average of the benchmark interest rates in 
proportion to the respective loan contribution, should be offered.  The interest rate charged 
by the bank for its portion of credit, shall be subject to applicable directions on interest rates 
on advances . Further, the NBFC -MFIs which are categorized as NBFC -ND-SIs, are also 
required to abide by the pricing of credit and other applicable guidelines for loans covered 
under “Qualifying Assets” regarding their contribution towards the co-originated loan. It is 
envisaged that the benefit of low cost funds from banks and lower  cost of operations of 
NBFC would be passed on to the ultimate beneficiary through the blended rate/ weighted 
average rate. In this regard, banks/NBFCs shall provide all the information like loan details 
including interest rate and other charges, details of risk sharing arrangement,  etc., as and 
when called for by the Reserve Bank of India.  
 
5. While engaging in co -origination arrangements, inter-alia, the bank / NBFC is required to 
adhere to extant guidelines on outsourcing of financial services. Accordingly, though the 
NBFC is expected to source loans as per the mutually agreed parameters between the bank 
and the NBFC, bank shall not outsource its part of credit sanction component to the NBFC. 
 
6. With regard to grievance redressal, any complaint registered by a borrower with the 
NBFC/ bank shall also be shared with the bank / NBFC; in case the complaint is not resolved 
within 30 days, the borrower would have the option to escalate the same with the concerned 
Banking Ombudsman/ Ombudsman for NBFCs. 
 
7. The bank/ NBFC shall formulate a Board approved policy for entering into a co-origination 
agreement with the NBFC/ bank . The loans under the co-origination agreement shall be 
subjected to periodic verification by bank’s/ NBFC’s internal auditors to ensure adherence to 
its internal guidelines, terms of the agreement and extant regulatory requirements. 
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
 
(Gautam Prasad Borah) 
Chief General Manager-in-Charge 
 
Encl: As above

Annex 1

Essential Features of Co-origination Model between Banks and NBFC-ND-SIs 
 
I. Sharing of Risk and Rewards : Minimum 20% of the credit risk by way of direct exposure shall 
be on NBFC ’s books till maturity and the balance will be on bank’s books. The NBFC shall 
give an undertaking to the bank that its contribution towards the loan amount is not funded out 
of borrowing from the co-originating bank or any other group company of the partner bank.  
 
II. Interest Rate: NBFC would have the flexibility to price their part of the exposure, while bank 
shall price its part of the exposure in a manner found fit as per their respective risk appetite/ 
assessment of the borrower and the RBI regulations issued fro m time to time.  An indicative 
illustration for arriving at the  single blended/ weighted average rate is detailed in Annex 2. 
However, notwithstanding the charging of a single blended / weighted average rate of interest 
from the borrower, the repayment/ recovery of interest shall be shared between the bank and 
the NBFC in proportion to their share of credit and interest.  
 
III. Know Your Customer (KYC): The co-originating lenders shall adhere to applicable KYC/ AML 
guidelines, as prescribed by Department of Banking Regulation  (DBR)/ Department of Non-
Banking Regulation (DNBR) and may also be guided by Para 14 of Master Directions on 
KYC, issued by DBR. 
 
IV. Loan Sanction: The NBFC shall recommend to the Bank proposals as found relevant for joint  
lending. The lenders shall be entitled to independently assess the risks and requirements of 
the applicant borrowers . The loan agreement would be tripartite in nature, wherein, both the 
Bank and the NBFC shall be parties as lenders to the loan agreement with the customer. 
 
V. Common Account: The Bank and the NBFC shall open an escrow type common account for 
pooling respective loan contributions for disbursal as well  as to appropriate loan repayments 
from borrowers , without  holding the funds for usage of float. Regarding loan balances, the 
NBFC/ Bank  shall maintain individual borrower’s accounts and should also be able to 
generate and share a single unified statement to the customer, through appropriate sharing of 
required information with the Bank/ NBFC.  
 
VI. Monitoring & Recovery: Both lenders shall create the framework for day to day monitoring and 
recovery of the loan, as mutually agreed upon. 
 
VII. Security and Charge Creation:  The lenders shall arrange for creation of security and charge 
as per mutually agreeable terms.  
 
VIII. Provisioning/Reporting Requirement:  Each of the lenders shall follow its independent 
provisioning requirements including declaration of account as NPA, as per the regulatory 
guidelines respectively applicable to each of them. Each of the lenders shall carry out their

Annex 1 
2 | Page  
 
respective reporting requirements including reporting to Credit Information Companies, under 
respectively applicable law and regulations for their portion of lending. 
 
IX. Assignment/ Change in Loan Limits : Any assignment of loans by any of the lenders can be 
done only with the mutual consent of both the l enders. Further, any change in loan limit of the 
co-originated facility can be done only with the mutual consent of both the lenders.  
 
X. Grievance Redressal:  It shall be the responsibility of the NBFC to explain to end borrower 
regarding the difference between products offered through the co- origination model as 
compared to its own products. The front-ending lender will be primarily responsible for 
providing the required customer service and grievance redressal to the borrower.  However, 
any complaint registered by a borrower with the NBFC and/or bank shall also be shared with 
the bank/ NBFC and in case, the complaint is not resolved within 30 days, the borrower would 
have the option to escalate the same with concerned Banking Ombudsman/ Ombudsman for 
NBFCs. 
 
XI. Business Continuity Plan:  Both the bank and the NBFC shall formulate a business continuity 
plan to ensure uninterrupted service to the borrowers till repayment  of the loans under the co-
origination agreement.
