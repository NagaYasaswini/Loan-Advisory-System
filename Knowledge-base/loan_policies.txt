Specific Loan Categories/Limits (Examples):

Individual Exposure Limits: While not a universal rule, the RBI expects banks to manage their exposure to single borrowers or groups of connected borrowers. For instance, for large exposures, there might be specific guidelines.
Priority Sector Lending: The RBI mandates that a certain percentage of a bank's Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) must be directed towards "priority sectors" like agriculture, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), education, housing, etc. While this isn't a direct limit on an applicant, it influences the availability of loans in these sectors and may involve specific schemes with their own criteria.
Housing Loans: The RBI has specific Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio norms for housing loans, which means banks can only finance a certain percentage of the property's value (e.g., 75-90% depending on the loan amount). This acts as a practical limit on the maximum loan amount an applicant can get relative to the property's cost.
Gold Loans: There are often LTV restrictions for gold loans as well.
Unsecured Loans (Personal Loans, Credit Cards): While the RBI doesn't set a direct maximum loan amount, it emphasizes prudent risk management for these loans due to their unsecured nature. Banks typically have their own internal limits based on the applicant's income, credit score, and debt-to-income ratio.
Education Loans: The RBI provides a model education loan scheme, which banks generally follow, outlining eligibility, loan amounts, and security requirements.

Key Factors Considered by Banks (derived from RBI guidelines):

Credit Information: Banks must access credit information from credit bureaus (like CIBIL, Experian, Equifax, CRIF High Mark) before sanctioning fresh loans or enhancing existing limits. A poor credit score or history is a major limiting factor.
Repayment Capacity: This is paramount. Banks assess income, existing liabilities, and financial stability to determine if the applicant can comfortably repay the loan. The Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio is a common tool.
Security/Collateral: For secured loans (home loans, car loans, loans against property), the value and type of collateral offered play a crucial role in determining the loan amount.
Age and Income: While not strictly RBI "limits," these are standard bank criteria influenced by risk management. There are often minimum and maximum age limits (e.g., 21 to 60/65 years for salaried individuals) and minimum income requirements.
Know Your Customer (KYC) Norms: Adherence to KYC guidelines is mandatory for all loan applicants.
Purpose of Loan: The RBI requires banks to understand the purpose of the loan, especially for larger amounts, to prevent misuse or illegal activities.
