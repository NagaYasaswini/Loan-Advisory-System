       "\"# RBI-Aligned Policies and Eligibilities for Applying and Getting Loans from Banks\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates the banking sector in India to ensure transparency, fair practices, and financial stability. RBI guidelines on loans and advances cover aspects such as Know Your Customer (KYC) norms, creditworthiness assessment, interest rate linkages to external benchmarks, and specific requirements for different loan types. These apply to all scheduled commercial banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). Borrowers must meet eligibility criteria based on credit score, income, and purpose of the loan. This document summarizes key RBI-aligned policies and eligibilities for major loan categories, focusing on application and approval processes. All banks must adhere to the Fair Practices Code, ensuring transparent communication and no harassment during recovery.\\n\\n**Note:** Policies are subject to updates; always verify with the latest RBI circulars. As of September 28, 2025, repo rate is 6.00%.\\n\\n## General RBI Guidelines for All Loans\\n\\n### Key Policies\\n- **KYC and Customer Due Diligence (CDD):** Mandatory Aadhaar, PAN, or Officially Valid Documents (OVD) like passport or Voter ID. Risk-based approach for high-risk borrowers (e.g., Politically Exposed Persons require enhanced due diligence).\\n- **Credit Assessment:** Banks must evaluate credit score (typically ≥670), income stability, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio (DTI; ideally <50%).\\n- **Interest Rates:** Linked to external benchmarks (e.g., repo rate).

RBI guidelines on loans and advances cover aspects such as Know Your Customer (KYC) norms, creditworthiness assessment, interest rate linkages to external benchmarks, and specific requirements for different loan types. These apply to all scheduled commercial banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). Borrowers must meet eligibility criteria based on credit score, income, and purpose of the loan. This document summarizes key RBI-aligned policies and eligibilities for major loan categories, focusing on application and approval processes. All banks must adhere to the Fair Practices Code, ensuring transparent communication and no harassment during recovery.\\n\\n**Note:** Policies are subject to updates; always verify with the latest RBI circulars. As of September 28, 2025, repo rate is 6.00%.\\n\\n## General RBI Guidelines for All Loans\\n\\n### Key Policies\\n- **KYC and Customer Due Diligence (CDD):** Mandatory Aadhaar, PAN, or Officially Valid Documents (OVD) like passport or Voter ID. Risk-based approach for high-risk borrowers (e.g., Politically Exposed Persons require enhanced due diligence).\\n- **Credit Assessment:** Banks must evaluate credit score (typically ≥670), income stability, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio (DTI; ideally <50%).\\n- **Interest Rates:** Linked to external benchmarks (e.g., repo rate). Transparent disclosure of Annual Percentage Rate (APR), including fees.\\n- **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio:** Varies by loan type; ensures borrower equity.\\n- **Prepayment and Foreclosure:** No charges for floating-rate loans; capped at 3-4% for fixed-rate.\\n- **Processing and Disbursement:** Acknowledgment of applications within timelines; no hidden charges.

The detailed guidelines in this regard are as under.  \\n  \\n2. All scheduled commercial banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks and Small Finance \\nBanks) may engage with N BFC-ND-SIs (hereinafter referred to as NBFC)  to co-originate \\nloans for the creation of priority sector assets. The arrangement should entail joint \\ncontribution of credit at the facility level, by both lenders. It should also involve sharing of \\nrisks and rewards between the bank and the NBFC for ensuring appropriate alignment of \\nrespective business objectives , as per the mutually decided agreement between the bank \\nand the NBFC, inter-alia, covering the essential features as indicated in Annex 1.  \\n \\n3. The bank can claim priority sector status in respect of its share of credit while engaging in  \\nthe co-origination arrangement. However, the priority sector assets on the bank ’s books \\nshould at all times be without recourse to the NBFC. Further, the loans extended by foreign \\nbanks under the co-origination framework  shall be restricted only to loans qualifying as  \\npriority sector assets.\\n\\nCo-origination of loans by Banks and NBFCs for lending to priority sector \\n \\n4. Based on the respective interest rates and proportion of risk sharin g, a single blended \\ninterest rate should be offered to the ultimate borrower  in case of fixed rate loans. In the \\nscenario of floating interest rates , a weighted average of the benchmark interest rates in \\nproportion to the respective loan contribution, should be offered.  The interest rate charged \\nby the bank for its portion of credit, shall be subject to applicable directions on interest rates \\non advances . Further, the NBFC -MFIs which are categorized as NBFC -ND-SIs, are also \\nrequired to abide by the pricing of credit and other applicable guidelines for loans covered \\nunder “Qualifying Assets” regarding their contribution towards the co-originated loan. It is \\nenvisaged that the benefit of low cost funds from banks and lower  cost of operations of \\nNBFC would be passed on to the ultimate beneficiary through the blended rate/ weighted \\naverage rate. In this regard, banks/NBFCs shall provide all the information like loan details \\nincluding interest rate and other charges, details of risk sharing arrangement,  etc., as and \\nwhen called for by the Reserve Bank of India.  \\n \\n5. While engaging in co -origination arrangements, inter-alia, the bank / NBFC is required to \\nadhere to extant guidelines on outsourcing of financial services. Accordingly, though the \\nNBFC is expected to source loans as per the mutually agreed parameters between the bank \\nand the NBFC, bank shall not outsource its part of credit sanction component to the NBFC. \\n \\n6. With regard to grievance redressal, any complaint registered by a borrower with the \\nNBFC/ bank shall also be shared with the bank / NBFC; in case the complaint is not resolved \\nwithin 30 days, the borrower would have the option to escalate the same with the concerned \\nBanking Ombudsman/ Ombudsman for NBFCs. \\n \\n7. The bank/ NBFC shall formulate a Board approved policy for entering into a co-origination \\nagreement with the NBFC/ bank . The loans under the co-origination agreement shall be \\nsubjected to periodic verification by bank’s/ NBFC’s internal auditors to ensure adherence to \\nits internal guidelines, terms of the agreement and extant regulatory requirements. \\n \\nYours faithfully, \\n \\n \\n(Gautam Prasad Borah) \\nChief General Manager-in-Charge \\n \\nEncl: As above\\n\\nAnnex 1 \\n1 | Page  \\n \\nEssential Features of Co-origination Model between Banks and NBFC-ND-SIs \\n \\nI. Sharing of Risk and Rewards : Minimum 20% of the credit risk by way of direct exposure shall \\nbe on NBFC ’s books till maturity and the balance will be on bank’s books. The NBFC shall \\ngive an undertaking to the bank that its contribution towards the loan amount is not funded out \\nof borrowing from the co-originating bank or any other group company of the partner bank.  \\n \\nII. Interest Rate: NBFC would have the flexibility to price their part of the exposure, while bank \\nshall price its part of the exposure in a manner found fit as per their respective risk appetite/ \\nassessment of the borrower and the RBI regulations issued fro m time to time.  An indicative \\nillustration for arriving at the  single blended/ weighted average rate is detailed in Annex 2. \\nHowever, notwithstanding the charging of a single blended / weighted average rate of interest \\nfrom the borrower, the repayment/ recovery of interest shall be shared between the bank and \\nthe NBFC in proportion to their share of credit and interest.  \\n \\nIII. Know Your Customer (KYC): The co-originating lenders shall adhere to applicable KYC/ AML \\nguidelines, as prescribed by Department of Banking Regulation  (DBR)/ Department of Non-\\nBanking Regulation (DNBR) and may also be guided by Para 14 of Master Directions on \\nKYC, issued by DBR. \\n \\nIV. Loan Sanction: The NBFC shall recommend to the Bank proposals as found relevant for joint  \\nlending. The lenders shall be entitled to independently assess the risks and requirements of \\nthe applicant borrowers . The loan agreement would be tripartite in nature, wherein, both the \\nBank and the NBFC shall be parties as lenders to the loan agreement with the customer. \\n \\nV. Common Account: The Bank and the NBFC shall open an escrow type common account for \\npooling respective loan contributions for disbursal as well  as to appropriate loan repayments \\nfrom borrowers , without  holding the funds for usage of float. Regarding loan balances, the \\nNBFC/ Bank  shall maintain individual borrower’s accounts and should also be able to \\ngenerate and share a single unified statement to the customer, through appropriate sharing of \\nrequired information with the Bank/ NBFC.  \\n \\nVI. Monitoring & Recovery: Both lenders shall create the framework for day to day monitoring and \\nrecovery of the loan, as mutually agreed upon. \\n \\nVII. Security and Charge Creation:  The lenders shall arrange for creation of security and charge \\nas per mutually agreeable terms.  \\n \\nVIII. Provisioning/Reporting Requirement:  Each of the lenders shall follow its independent \\nprovisioning requirements including declaration of account as NPA, as per the regulatory \\nguidelines respectively applicable to each of them. Each of the lenders shall carry out their\\n\\nAnnex 1 \\n2 | Page  \\n \\nrespective reporting requirements including reporting to Credit Information Companies, under \\nrespectively applicable law and regulations for their portion of lending. \\n \\nIX. Assignment/ Change in Loan Limits : Any assignment of loans by any of the lenders can be \\ndone only with the mutual consent of both the l enders. Further, any change in loan limit of the \\nco-originated facility can be done only with the mutual consent of both the lenders.  \\n \\nX. Grievance Redressal:  It shall be the responsibility of the NBFC to explain to end borrower \\nregarding the difference between products offered through the co- origination model as \\ncompared to its own products. The front-ending lender will be primarily responsible for \\nproviding the required customer service and grievance redressal to the borrower.  However, \\nany complaint registered by a borrower with the NBFC and/or bank shall also be shared with \\nthe bank/ NBFC and in case, the complaint is not resolved within 30 days, the borrower would \\nhave the option to escalate the same with concerned Banking Ombudsman/ Ombudsman for \\nNBFCs. \\n \\nXI. Business Continuity Plan:  Both the bank and the NBFC shall formulate a business continuity \\nplan to ensure uninterrupted service to the borrowers till repayment  of the loans under the co-\\norigination agreement.\\n\\nAnnex 2 \\nIndicative Illustration for calculation of Blended/ Weighted Average Interest Rate \\nScenario 1: Fixed interest rates \\nCustomers are offered fixed interest rate throughout life of loan.  \\n Example 1  Example 2 \\nBlended interest rate calculations Bank NBFC  Bank NBFC \\nBenchmark Interest Rate 8% 9%  8% 9% \\nSpread 2% 3%  2% 3% \\nInterest rate to consumer 10% (A) 12% (B)  10% (A) 12% (B) \\nLoan contribution ratio 80%(C) 20%(D)  70%(C) 30%(D) \\nBlended interest rate (A*C)+(B*D)= E 10.40%  10.60% \\n \\nScenario 2: Floating interest rates \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nOther Charges \\nAny other applicable charges , will be decided mutually between co-originating lenders and communicated \\nto the customer.  \\nNote: The above illustration is o nly indicative in nature and is  not mandatory.

RBI guidelines on loans and advances cover aspects such as Know Your Customer (KYC) norms, creditworthiness assessment, interest rate linkages to external benchmarks, and specific requirements for different loan types. These apply to all scheduled commercial banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). Borrowers must meet eligibility criteria based on credit score, income, and purpose of the loan. This document summarizes key RBI-aligned policies and eligibilities for major loan categories, focusing on application and approval processes. All banks must adhere to the Fair Practices Code, ensuring transparent communication and no harassment during recovery.  \\n**Note:** Policies are subject to updates; always verify with the latest RBI circulars.

The detailed guidelines in this regard are as under.  \\n2. All scheduled commercial banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks and Small Finance\\nBanks) may engage with N BFC-ND-SIs (hereinafter referred to as NBFC)  to co-originate\\nloans for the creation of priority sector assets. The arrangement should entail joint\\ncontribution of credit at the facility level, by both lenders. It should also involve sharing of\\nrisks and rewards between the bank and the NBFC for ensuring appropriate alignment of\\nrespective business objectives , as per the mutually decided agreement between the bank\\nand the NBFC, inter-alia, covering the essential features as indicated in Annex 1.  \\n3. The bank can claim priority sector status in respect of its share of credit while engaging in\\nthe co-origination arrangement. However, the priority sector assets on the bank ’s books\\nshould at all times be without recourse to the NBFC. Further, the loans extended by foreign\\nbanks under the co-origination framework  shall be restricted only to loans qualifying as\\npriority sector assets.  \\nCo-origination of loans by Banks and NBFCs for lending to priority sector  \\n4. Based on the respective interest rates and proportion of risk sharin g, a single blended\\ninterest rate should be offered to the ultimate borrower  in case of fixed rate loans. In the\\nscenario of floating interest rates , a weighted average of the benchmark interest rates in\\nproportion to the respective loan contribution, should be offered.  The interest rate charged\\nby the bank for its portion of credit, shall be subject to applicable directions on interest rates\\non advances . Further, the NBFC -MFIs which are categorized as NBFC -ND-SIs, are also\\nrequired to abide by the pricing of credit and other applicable guidelines for loans covered\\nunder “Qualifying Assets” regarding their contribution towards the co-originated loan. It is\\nenvisaged that the benefit of low cost funds from banks and lower  cost of operations of\\nNBFC would be passed on to the ultimate beneficiary through the blended rate/ weighted\\naverage rate. In this regard, banks/NBFCs shall provide all the information like loan details\\nincluding interest rate and other charges, details of risk sharing arrangement,  etc., as and\\nwhen called for by the Reserve Bank of India.  \\n5. While engaging in co -origination arrangements, inter-alia, the bank / NBFC is required to\\nadhere to extant guidelines on outsourcing of financial services. Accordingly, though the\\nNBFC is expected to source loans as per the mutually agreed parameters between the bank\\nand the NBFC, bank shall not outsource its part of credit sanction component to the NBFC.  \\n6. With regard to grievance redressal, any complaint registered by a borrower with the\\nNBFC/ bank shall also be shared with the bank / NBFC; in case the complaint is not resolved\\nwithin 30 days, the borrower would have the option to escalate the same with the concerned\\nBanking Ombudsman/ Ombudsman for NBFCs.  \\n7. The bank/ NBFC shall formulate a Board approved policy for entering into a co-origination\\nagreement with the NBFC/ bank . The loans under the co-origination agreement shall be\\nsubjected to periodic verification by bank’s/ NBFC’s internal auditors to ensure adherence to\\nits internal guidelines, terms of the agreement and extant regulatory requirements.  \\nYours faithfully,  \\n(Gautam Prasad Borah)\\nChief General Manager-in-Charge  \\nEncl: As above  \\nAnnex 1\\n1 | Page  \\nEssential Features of Co-origination Model between Banks and NBFC-ND-SIs  \\nI. Sharing of Risk and Rewards : Minimum 20% of the credit risk by way of direct exposure shall\\nbe on NBFC ’s books till maturity and the balance will be on bank’s books. The NBFC shall\\ngive an undertaking to the bank that its contribution towards the loan amount is not funded out\\nof borrowing from the co-originating bank or any other group company of the partner bank.  \\nII. Interest Rate: NBFC would have the flexibility to price their part of the exposure, while bank\\nshall price its part of the exposure in a manner found fit as per their respective risk appetite/\\nassessment of the borrower and the RBI regulations issued fro m time to time.  An indicative\\nillustration for arriving at the  single blended/ weighted average rate is detailed in Annex 2.\\nHowever, notwithstanding the charging of a single blended / weighted average rate of interest\\nfrom the borrower, the repayment/ recovery of interest shall be shared between the bank and\\nthe NBFC in proportion to their share of credit and interest.  \\nIII. Know Your Customer (KYC): The co-originating lenders shall adhere to applicable KYC/ AML\\nguidelines, as prescribed by Department of Banking Regulation  (DBR)/ Department of Non-\\nBanking Regulation (DNBR) and may also be guided by Para 14 of Master Directions on\\nKYC, issued by DBR.  \\nIV. Loan Sanction: The NBFC shall recommend to the Bank proposals as found relevant for joint\\nlending. The lenders shall be entitled to independently assess the risks and requirements of\\nthe applicant borrowers . The loan agreement would be tripartite in nature, wherein, both the\\nBank and the NBFC shall be parties as lenders to the loan agreement with the customer.  \\nV. Common Account: The Bank and the NBFC shall open an escrow type common account for\\npooling respective loan contributions for disbursal as well  as to appropriate loan repayments\\nfrom borrowers , without  holding the funds for usage of float. Regarding loan balances, the\\nNBFC/ Bank  shall maintain individual borrower’s accounts and should also be able to\\ngenerate and share a single unified statement to the customer, through appropriate sharing of\\nrequired information with the Bank/ NBFC.  \\nVI. Monitoring & Recovery: Both lenders shall create the framework for day to day monitoring and\\nrecovery of the loan, as mutually agreed upon.  \\nVII. Security and Charge Creation:  The lenders shall arrange for creation of security and charge\\nas per mutually agreeable terms.  \\nVIII. Provisioning/Reporting Requirement:  Each of the lenders shall follow its independent\\nprovisioning requirements including declaration of account as NPA, as per the regulatory\\nguidelines respectively applicable to each of them. Each of the lenders shall carry out their  \\nAnnex 1\\n2 | Page  \\nrespective reporting requirements including reporting to Credit Information Companies, under\\nrespectively applicable law and regulations for their portion of lending.  \\nIX. Assignment/ Change in Loan Limits : Any assignment of loans by any of the lenders can be\\ndone only with the mutual consent of both the l enders. Further, any change in loan limit of the\\nco-originated facility can be done only with the mutual consent of both the lenders.  \\nX. Grievance Redressal:  It shall be the responsibility of the NBFC to explain to end borrower\\nregarding the difference between products offered through the co- origination model as\\ncompared to its own products. The front-ending lender will be primarily responsible for\\nproviding the required customer service and grievance redressal to the borrower.  However,\\nany complaint registered by a borrower with the NBFC and/or bank shall also be shared with\\nthe bank/ NBFC and in case, the complaint is not resolved within 30 days, the borrower would\\nhave the option to escalate the same with concerned Banking Ombudsman/ Ombudsman for\\nNBFCs.  \\nXI. Business Continuity Plan:  Both the bank and the NBFC shall formulate a business continuity\\nplan to ensure uninterrupted service to the borrowers till repayment  of the loans under the co-\\norigination agreement.  \\nAnnex 2\\nIndicative Illustration for calculation of Blended/ Weighted Average Interest Rate\\nScenario 1: Fixed interest rates\\nCustomers are offered fixed interest rate throughout life of loan.\\nExample 1  Example 2\\nBlended interest rate calculations Bank NBFC  Bank NBFC\\nBenchmark Interest Rate 8% 9%  8% 9%\\nSpread 2% 3%  2% 3%\\nInterest rate to consumer 10% (A) 12% (B)  10% (A) 12% (B)\\nLoan contribution ratio 80%(C) 20%(D)  70%(C) 30%(D)\\nBlended interest rate (A*C)+(B*D)= E 10.40%  10.60%  \\nScenario 2: Floating interest rates  \\nOther Charges\\nAny other applicable charges , will be decided mutually between co-originating lenders and communicated\\nto the customer.\\nNote: The above illustration is o nly indicative in nature and is  not mandatory.
